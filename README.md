The project's aim was to develop an API that:
1. Receives a numerical input.
2. Categorizes the number based on its mathematical attributes.
3. Provides results in a structured JSON format.
4. Obtains an intriguing fact about the number from an external source.
5. Manages errors effectively and follows industry standards.

The API was made accessible via a public endpoint, with the source code hosted on GitHub, accompanied by a comprehensive README.md file.


Obstacles and Resolutions
Obstacle 1: Managing Improper Input
The API initially failed when non-integer input was provided. This issue was resolved by implementing input verification and sending a 400 Bad Request response when necessary.

Obstacle 2: Retrieving Interesting Facts
Occasional timeouts and errors occurred with the external Numbers API. To maintain API stability, error management was incorporated.

Obstacle 3: Implementation
Initial difficulties arose during API deployment due to setup issues. These were overcome by meticulously following the deployment platform's guidelines and conducting local API tests prior to implementation.


Example Usage
Request
GET /api/classify-number?number=371
Response
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}

Final Thoughts
This endeavor provided valuable insights, resulting in a satisfactory end product. The API demonstrates speed, dependability, and user-friendliness. For those interested in examining the code or testing the API, the GitHub repository is available.
